## **Overview**
The Tokenomics for Shield is designed to ensure sustainability, foster community participation, and maintain fair distribution. Below is the breakdown of token allocation, represented in the pie chart:

---

## **Token Distribution**
1. **Liquidity Pool (DEX) (65%)**  
   The largest portion is allocated to providing liquidity on decentralized exchanges (DEX). This ensures that SHIELD tokens are easily accessible to users from the beginning.  

2. **Community & Airdrop (15%)**  
   Allocated to drive initial adoption through airdrops, community incentives, and strategic promotions.  

3. **Staking & Reward (15%)**  
   Reserved for staking incentives, allowing users to lock their tokens and earn rewards as a form of participation in the network.  

4. **Team & Developers (5%)**  
   Allocated to the development team, with a vesting period to ensure long-term commitment to the project.
